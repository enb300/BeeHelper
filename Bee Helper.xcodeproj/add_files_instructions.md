# Instructions for Adding Files to Xcode Project

Since the command line approach didn't work, you'll need to add these files manually to your Xcode project:

## Files to Add:

### 1. Dictionary File
- **File**: `cleaned_scraped_words.txt`
- **Location**: Root of project directory
- **How to add**: Drag and drop into Xcode project navigator, make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked

### 2. Swift Files

#### Main App File:
- **File**: `Bee Helper/Bee_HelperApp.swift`
- **Location**: `Bee Helper/` folder
- **How to add**: Drag and drop into Xcode project navigator

#### Views:
- **File**: `Bee Helper/Views/ContentView.swift`
- **File**: `Bee Helper/Views/ManualInputView.swift`
- **File**: `Bee Helper/Views/TodayView.swift`
- **File**: `Bee Helper/Views/ArchiveView.swift`
- **File**: `Bee Helper/Views/SettingsView.swift`
- **Location**: `Bee Helper/Views/` folder
- **How to add**: Drag and drop into Xcode project navigator

#### Services:
- **File**: `Bee Helper/Services/DictionaryService.swift` (already exists)
- **Location**: `Bee Helper/Services/` folder

## Steps to Add Files:

1. Open your Xcode project
2. In the Project Navigator (left sidebar), right-click on the "Bee Helper" folder
3. Select "Add Files to 'Bee Helper'"
4. Navigate to each file and add it
5. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked
6. Select the "Bee Helper" target when prompted

## Manual Entry Features:

The ManualInputView now includes:

✅ **One letter per box** - Each text field accepts only one character
✅ **Auto-advance** - Automatically moves to the next field when you type
✅ **Center letter selection** - Tap any letter to make it the center letter
✅ **Real-time validation** - Shows if the puzzle is valid (7 unique letters)
✅ **Dictionary validation** - Uses the comprehensive word list you provided
✅ **Word generation** - Generates all valid Spelling Bee words
✅ **Results display** - Shows statistics and word list with pangram indicators

## Testing the Manual Entry:

1. Open the app
2. Go to the "Manual Entry" tab
3. Type letters one by one - they should auto-advance
4. Select a center letter by tapping one of the letter buttons
5. Tap "Generate Words" to see the results

The app will now use your comprehensive dictionary file (`cleaned_scraped_words.txt`) for word validation and generation.
